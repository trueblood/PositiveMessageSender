## Ways for other developers to contribute
* Setup subscriptions so messages are auto generated daily to signed up users. To do this I'll need to setup a service running on a server or use a service like Hangfire. 
* Also want to setup a user dashboard so they can change their user password and see their sent messages from their account and modify the daily generated messages turn off and use an api to pull in holidays and make the positive message have something to do with the day's holiday. 
* Also need to implement captcha.
